We recommend, however, that while EDAM is being actively maintained by its authors, substantial derived work, major modifications (especially conceptual and semantic), and re-definitions of concepts and other content (*e.g.* additional constraints on EDAM concepts/OWL classes within ``owl:imports`` meant with universal validity, that would "close" some desired options of the open-world assumption) are consulted with the EDAM developers beforehand at the time of consideration, and consistent solutions are sought in collaboration.
