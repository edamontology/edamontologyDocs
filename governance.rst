Governance
==========

EDAM follows a model with four tiers of governance:

1. **EDAM Steering Group** advises the EDAM Developers on how best to uphold the EDAM principles and achieve its current aims.  It includes (and is open to) representatives of institutes and projects that are adopting EDAM or committing significant resources to it's development.  Steering Group `members <http://edamontologydocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributors.html#edam-steering-group>`_ have five primary responsibilities:

  * Help to set priorities in consultation with the Developers
  * Verify whether stated aims are coherent and wise
  * Monitor progress and provide feedback
  * Help arrange funding for EDAM
  * Advocate EDAM
   
  The EDAM Developers will respect advice of the Steering Group and give progress reports by email.  The Steering Group will be reconstituted (by the Developers) as and when required to ensure membership reflects current activity and interest. 

2. **EDAM Developers** are typically funded to develop EDAM.  The group is quasi-democratic with a leader (currently Jon Ison) having the final say where necessary (it seldom is).  The leader ensures the Steering Group, and all developers, editors and contributors, are listened to, respected and informed. The leader may be temporarily appointed from the developers as necessary, *e.g.* during holidays.  `Developers <http://edamontologydocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributors.html#edam-developers>`_ must have the intent and some capacity to develop EDAM in the long-term. They have 3 primary responsibilities: 

  * Agree aims and general good practice to uphold the EDAM principles
  * Oversee and approve developments and routine maintenance
  * Develop EDAM as bandwidth permits

3. **EDAM Editors** represent the broad life science community, especially scientific experts and end-users.  They include anyone who makes significant contributions to EDAM scientific content, by whatever means, but have none of the commitments or responsibilities of the developers.  `EDAM Editors <http://edamontologydocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributors.html#edam-editors>`_ are expected to:

  * Actively offer constructive advice based on their practical experience, requirements and expertise
  * Advocate EDAM
  * Contribute to EDAM as bandwidth permits

.. note::
   The ELIXIR Tools Platform is working to support Thematic Editors to oversee coverage and quality of bio.tools and EDAM in specific thematic areas. The editorships will enable expanding accurate high-standard software annotations in bio.tools to most scientific topics in life science.  Please see the emerging `Editors Guide <>`_.  In due course, we expect to consolidate the named `EDAM Editors <http://edamontologydocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributors.html#edam-editors>`_ and `Thematic Editors <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/editors_guide.html#current-thematic-editors>`_ into a single group.
    
4. **Other contributors** do not have GitHub commit rights but can still make comments, contribute suggestions for new terms and other changes.  New `contributors <http://edamontologydocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributors.html#id1>`_ are strongly encouraged.

We very much welcome new members of the team at all levels above.  Representatives of projects who plan to adopt EDAM are encouraged to join the EDAM Advisory Group.  For futher information please see the `documentation <http://edamontology.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting involved.html>`_ or mail edam-dev@elixir-dk.org.
