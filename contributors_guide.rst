We'll make every effort to be responsive, given our limited resources, and will work with you to find the most efficient way to proceed, depending on your requirements, expertise and bandwidth.

.. note::
   Most discussion occurs on the `GitHub tracker <https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/issues/new>`_!


Suggestions & requests
----------------------
Suggestions for addition, corrections, and other improvements to EDAM are always welcome! 

If you have a GitHub account, you can make suggestions and requests by opening a GitHub issue.  We strongly recommend you get an account, if needed, - it only takes a minute!  Our tracker includes templates for various `types of suggestion <https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/issues/new/choose>`_:

- Go to https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/issues and click on "New issue"
- If you're not logged in, you'll be asked first to log in or create an account
- Click the "Get started" next to the type of request you want to make
- Provide a title, and then follow instructions in the template, providing as much information as possible

Each template includes detailed instructions, which you'll see when you create an issue, or you can read about them beforehand `here <https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE>`_.

If you can't find the template you need, click "Open a regular issue" and provide concise information, but sufficiently detailed to be actionable.

When requesting new concepts, the bare-bones required information (common to all subontologies) is:

- EDAM sub-ontology (Topic, Operation, Format, Data, Identifier)
- term (the most common term used to refer to the concept)
- short description (a couple of sentences)
  
It will speed up things a lot if you can provide as much information as possible, but especially:

- URL of suggested parent
- exact synonyms (other commonly-used terms, acronyms *etc.* by which the concept is referred to)
- narrow synonyms (terms reflecting specialisations of the concept.  Narrow synonyms can be defined to avoid creating overly-specialised concepts.)

If it turns out you need a lot of new concepts, we can find a more efficient way (*e.g.* shared Google sheet), and you can join us as an `EDAM Editor <http://edamontologydocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/governance.html>`_


Suggestions form
----------------
If you're unwilling to get a GitHub account, then simple requests for one or a few changes can be made using this form:

http://tinyurl.com/EDAMChangeRequest 

If you require many changes and additions, there's probably a more efficient way to proceed: please contact edam@elixir-dk.org.  You'll need to `subscribe <http://elixirmail.cbs.dtu.dk/mailman/listinfo/edam>`_ to the list first.


Joining the team
----------------
